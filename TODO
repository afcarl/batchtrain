* Write a README
    * Shuffle training examples.
    * Basic description about how to get starcluster set up.
        * Need mongo installed in each node.
        * Need scikit-learn installed in each node.
            * Is there an easy way to do this?
        * Would work in general on any SGE cluster.
    * Cite Ng work.
    * Describe how to play with hyperparameter values.
    * Limitation about converting everything to dense.
        * Is this even necessary?
    * jobman.py loosely inspired by UdeM's jobman.

* hyperparameters.yaml or hyperparameters.py file

* Discuss taskmin functionality, show how it can be added back

* Move NFOLDS to locals.py, and assume we're always doing k-fold crossvalidation

* Choice of evaluation criterion

* We convert to dense in scikit-job.py. Can we avoid this?


* Folds are shuffled? Or not? Because if the person hasn't shuffled
their examples, we want to shuffle the fold indices.

* EXPERIMENT_NAME should be derived from hashing the dataset.

* Instead of creating a shell script, directly submit to qsub.

* Demo and instructions for how to use script from end-to-end.
    * Using 20newsgroups.

* Add support for binary classification + regression.

* pip install.
